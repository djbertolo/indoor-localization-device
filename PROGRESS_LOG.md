### Challenges / Issues:
*Problems encountered and support needed!*
- System Specifications requires System Analysis yet the system remains unfinished and unable to be tested according to requirement specifications and system specifications indicated requirements.
- Shipping time varies between each core component, testing for functionality can be heavily impacted by the order in which the parts arrive.

### Next Steps
*Goals and focuses for next week!*
- Configure BLE beacons
